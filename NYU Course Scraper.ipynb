The first third of the course orients students towards the structural properties of language and the basics of linguistic analysis; assessments include linguistic data analysis. The second two-thirds of the course delve into the social context of indigenous languages and their speakers; assessments include reading presentations and written responses. We will discuss the social, economic and political factors that influence language use and particularly the shift from primary use of an indigenous language to primary use of a colonial language (e.g., English or Spanish). Topics covered include bilingualism, orthography school curriculum, language policy, and the intersection of language and human rights. This course has no pre-requisites, and is designed to appeal to students with a broad range of backgrounds and interests in language and linguistics, indigenous communities and indigenous identity, as well as education and social justice.\n",

To answer these questions, we will focus on such concepts as sound classes, features, phonemes, allophones, and syllable structure, and we will look at the role these concepts play in the most common phonological processes in the world's languages.

We will also discuss the constructionist argument that anatomy need not be linguistic destiny and that language may be used to perform social identities that do not match the individual’s biological characteristics. In this context, we will consider the limits and possibilities of gender self-[re]construction through language, including [re]naming strategies, and pronoun use, and coming-out stories.

These languages have flourished and diversified in the Americas: the Spanish spoken in 20 countries of the New World shows dialect differences between regions and nations, and collective differences with European Spanish. Brazilian Portuguese is markedly different from its European source. This diversity is partly a result of contact with other languages currently or formerly spoken in Latin America, especially the indigenous (Native American) languages like Quechua, Guarani, and Nahuatl, and African languages like Yoruba and Kimbundu. The course examines regional and national dialect differences in Latin American Spanish and Portuguese. We also consider social diversity: the ways of speaking of people of different social classes or ethnic backgrounds. Other languages spoken in the region are also considered, including indigenous languages, languages of immigrant groups, and contact languages and creoles, such as Haitian Creole and Papiamentu. Finally, we study the linguistic history of Latin America: how and why the languages spoken there spread, developed, changed and interacted.\n",

Many of the biggest successes in research toward this goal have relied on machine learning: a family of methods that allow computers to learn to reproduce some human behavior by example, rather than by explicit programming. This course covers widely-used machine learning methods for language understanding—with a special focus on machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks—and culminates in a substantial final project in which students write an original research paper in AI or computational linguistics. If you take this class, you’ll be exposed only to a fraction of the many approaches that researchers have used to teach language to computers. However, you’ll get training and practice with all the research skills that you’ll need to explore the field further on your own. This includes not only the skills to design and build computational models, but also to design experiments to test those models, to write and present your results, and to read and evaluate results from the scientific literature.\n",

      "➣ This course offers an overview of the field of first language acquisition. How does one develop from a pre- linguistic newborn infant to a mature language-user with a complex grammatical system (or systems)? What are the relative roles of inborn cognitive abilities and input (i.e., the language data the child hears or sees in their environment) in determining the properties and time course of language development? First language development is a multifaceted, robust phenomenon in our species that proceeds over many years of early life and provides an ultra-rich testing ground for psychological and linguistic theories. We will focus on linguistic development from birth through to early school age, looking at monolingual, bilingual, and atypical (e.g., Autism, Specific Language Impairment) populations. In the first half of the course we will focus on development in individual linguistic domains: phonology, vocabulary, morphosyntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In the latter half of the course, we will probe deeper into theoretical approaches to language acquisition, with a focus on primary literature and active debates in the field. We will also further explore the complex learning circumstances of certain populations, like children growing up bilingual and children presenting with atypical development, continually asking what evidence the diversity of learning situations brings to bear on the theoretical debates.\n"
